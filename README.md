# PROJECT AIM <br>
The main aim of this project is to build a model that can predict whether a patient has a Cardiovascular disease of not. This will help in the early detection of the disease and assit in preventing unforseen circumstances that can arrive due to complacency.

###  Overview of the dataset
__age__: The person’s age in years <br>
__sex__: The person’s sex (1 = male, 0 = female) <br>
__cp__: The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)<br>
__trestbps__: The person’s resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital) <br>
__chol__: The person’s cholesterol measurement in mg/dl <br>
__fbs__: The person’s fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false) <br>
__restecg__: Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes’ criteria) <br>
__thalach__: The person’s maximum heart rate achieved <br>
__exang__: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) <br>
__oldpeak__: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (‘ST’ relates to positions on the ECG plot. See more here) <br>
__slope__: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: downsloping) <br>
__ca__: The number of major vessels (0–3) <br>
__thal__: A blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect) <br>
__target__: Heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes) <br>
